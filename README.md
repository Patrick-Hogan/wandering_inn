# wandering_inn

**The wandering inn has requested in discourse that users not scrape the site; as a result, I've removed
all code that connects to wanderinginn.com and will reject any pull requests that attempt to add any 
ability to scrape the site.**

As far as I can tell, users are still allowed to manually save pages offline and this project may be helpful 
in creating an ebook from such a manual archive, so I'm leaving it online but likely won't actively support it.

TOOD: update script to work with manually-downloaded, offline html files

Convert [The Wandering Inn](https://wanderinginn.com/) to epub and mobi (kindle) format

I have no affiliation with and no rights to The Wandering Inn; I'm just a fan who likes to read on
my kindle and on my phone even when I don't have internet access. 

The created ebook sometimes has some rough patches to it; I'd encourage you to buy the [official
releases](https://www.amazon.com/pirate-aba/e/B07XCYVYMW?ref=dbs_mng_calw_a_0)
as they happen on Amazon to get a polished copy and [support the
author](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=4240617). I only created this project so I can catch/keep up
with the web publications.

This script relies on [ebookmaker](https://github.com/setanta/ebookmaker) and its dependencies, and
runs on python3. Converting to mobi format also relies on calibre, and the script is written for
bash.

# Usage

Will update if/when offline use is supported.
